# RLPCollectionImporter

part of #hack4OER on July 2016 http://hackathon2016.edu-sharing-network.org

The Idea is to import the XML data of the school curriculum of Berlin-Brandenburg and create from it a collection structure for OER (Open Educational Ressources) within an edu-sharing repo instance (using the REST API).

Check out, import in Eclipse as a Maven Project and run the JAVA main script: src/main/java/net/edusharing/collections/rlp/RLPCollectionImporter.java 

The school curriculum of Berlin-Brandenburg can be found in humanreadable version at:
http://bildungsserver.berlin-brandenburg.de/rlp-online/startseite/

Data Sources:

- XML schema: http://bsbb.eu/rlp110.xsd
- XML data: http://bsbb.eu/rlp110.xml
